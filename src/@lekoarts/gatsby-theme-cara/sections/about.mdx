## About

Other than programming, my academic interest is in math. It has been my favorite subject for as long as I can remember, 
and I don't see it stopping anytime soon. Whether it's from class, online videos, or books, I always enjoy learning new 
topics in the field.<br/><br/>

Outside of school, I love to stay active. Throughout college I have gotten into playing golf and tennis with friends, and 
I'll join just about every intramural sport available. Apart from these, I am on a powerbuilding weight training program and 
am training to run a marathon at the beginning of the summer.
